First we add another use statement, 
bringing a type called std::cmp::Ordering into scope 
from the standard library. The Ordering type 
is another enum and has the variants Less, Greater, 
and Equal. These are the three outcomes that are possible
when you compare two values.

We create a variable named guess. But wait, 
the program already have a variable named guess?
It does, but helpfully Rust allows us to shadow 
the previous value of guess with a new one. Shadowing 
lets us reuse the guess variable name rather than 
forcing us to create two unique variables, such as
guess_str and guess
